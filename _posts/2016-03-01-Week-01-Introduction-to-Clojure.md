Book : Clojure for the Brave and True

Clojure installation -> Leinigen (install notes here)

#What We Are About:
Clojure fans seeking other fans
Enthusiats
Geeks
Good People having a Good Time with a LISP

#What We are Not 
Experts (definitely)
Jerks (hopefully)
Arrogant Bastards (maybe)
Propellerheads (??)

#Proposed Format
Learning by experimentation, lots of it and getting fast feedback is essential to learning

Our goal is to do lots of experimenation and exercises.

Our goal is to NOT just sit around and listen to somebody drone on and read some slides .... therefore:

We invite you the attended to type along as we experiment and even *run-the-show* time to time

We may do the following in a "Socratic Style" of question / response to illuminate a particular idea or discover new things.

#Homework
We'll have you code and branch from a destination project which we'll build and keep track off <<<<<<here>>>>>>
We'll try to follow the themes set in CFTBAT chapter by chapter but may leave some of the details to the reader if we don't have the time to cover it.

We hope you will feel comfortable to ask quesitons - we dont have all the answers but we know where to find it - Hint it starts with G and ends with oogle. ;)

We hope you will find these sessions valuable - your feedback to help us help you (and ourselves) is greatly encouraged (stylistic, material)
If you have an idea please feel free not only to share but present it at the next meeting.
